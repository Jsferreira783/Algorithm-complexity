Problem 1: Mathematical Foundations 
Explanation: 

The program calculates the total distance between a series of delivery points and finds the sum of the first NNN natural numbers.First,
the user is asked to input how many delivery points there are. Then, for each delivery point, the user enters the x and y coordinates. 
These coordinates are stored in a list (vector) of pairs.The program then calculates the total distance traveled by summing the distances between each 
consecutive pair of delivery points using the Pythagorean theorem (to find the distance between two points). It also calculates the sum of the first NNN natural 
numbers using the formula N(N+1)2\frac{N(N + 1)}{2}2N(N+1) . 

Finally, it prints out both the total distance and the sum of the first NNN natural numbers, formatted in a way that lists the delivery points and results clearly.
The code runs in sequence: taking input, processing the distance and sum, and then displaying the output.
